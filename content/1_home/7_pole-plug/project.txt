Description: Compressed floor and ceiling strut system prototype. Modular shelves made up of 4 parts. This project is characterised by the use of simple metal parts which, when assembled, offer a choice of shelf layouts and other possible uses. The system is made up of 4 families of elements: - Compression legs These are the primary support elements. Steel tubes approximately 3m long are compressed at the top and bottom by screw-on glides. Once locked, these legs can support heavy loads. These tubes are drilled every 30 cm or so to allow support arms to be fitted. - The support arms These are fitted into the holes in the compression legs. They are solid round aluminium bars with a total length of around 60 cm. These support arms are used to insert the crosspieces that support the shelves. - The crosspieces These laser-cut parts are 5 mm thick aluminium crosspieces. They fit around the support arms and are secured by cleat systems. Precision cutting is required to minimise the clearance between the support arms and the crosspieces. - Shelf tops These wooden plates are perforated with 3 cm holes. The long edges (exposed at the front and back of the shelves) are rounded. The type of wood, its composition and possible treatment have yet to be defined.
