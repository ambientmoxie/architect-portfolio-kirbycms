Title: Parpaing

----

Description: The idea of the Parpaing lamp is born during a visit on an architectural project site. One evening, a group of workers built a makeshift light to help them get on with their work. At their disposal were scraps of metalwork, electricians' and bricklayers' leftovers... They spontaneously assemble a vertical mast using a painted steel bar, a flat sheet of metal as a base, a breeze block as a weight, and a vertical neon tube. and a vertical neon tube that they fix to the mast with clamps. Superb spontaneity. This object is imbued with a striking simplicity and poetry. There is joy and beauty in the obviousness of assembling these fragments to create a purely utilitarian object.
